# CCS Formalization in LEAN

This project aims to formalize several concepts of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) using LEAN, as taught in the theoretical part of the "Concurrent Programming" course at Saarland University. The project is intended for presentation at the Seminar "Computer-assisted proofs in Lean" led by Prof. Laurent Bartholdi at Saarland University. It is hoped that this project will be expanded upon in the future to provide a library of predefined structures and functions for those interested in CCS, facilitating further formalization.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to formalize the following:

- Reachability in LTS
- CCS semantics
- LTS isomorphism
- Bisimulation properties
- Trace equivalence
- Observation congruence

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions should adhere to the following guidelines. The project is maintained by Bashar Hamade and Rida Hamadani, feel free to reach out to us over the [LEAN Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/).

## Acknowledgements

We are grateful to the Concurrent Programming course instructors for their foundational teachings on CCS at Saarland University, and to Prof. Laurent Bartholdi for giving the "Computer-assisted proofs in Lean" seminar for which this project was originally created. Also special thanks to the wonderful people at the lean Zulip who answered our questions.
