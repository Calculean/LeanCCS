# CCS Formalization Project in LEAN

This project aims to formalize several concepts of the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) using LEAN, as taught in the theoretical part of the "Concurrent Programming" course at Saarland University. The project is intended for presentation at the Seminar "Computer-assisted proofs in Lean" led by Prof. Laurent Bartholdi at Saarland University. It is hoped that this project will be expanded upon in the future to provide a library of predefined structures and functions for those interested in CCS, facilitating further study and formalization of new concepts.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Formalization of Reachability in Labelled Transition Systems (LTS):**
   - Develop LEAN definitions and proofs for reachability within LTS frameworks.

2. **CCS Semantics:**
   - Define and formalize the semantics of CCS in LEAN, covering the core principles and operations.

3. **Inference Rules:**
   - Implement the inference rules used in CCS, providing formal proofs and verifications.

4. **LTS Isomorphism:**
   - Formalize the concept of isomorphism between LTSs, ensuring correctness and equivalence.

5. **Bisimulation:**
   - Define bisimulation within the context of CCS and provide formal proofs of its properties.

6. **Trace Equivalence:**
   - Formalize trace equivalence, ensuring accurate representation and proof within LEAN.

7. **Observation Congruence:**
   - Develop and prove observation congruence in LEAN, covering its implications and use cases.

## Future Work

This project is designed with future expansion in mind. Potential areas for further development include:

- Expanding the library of predefined structures and functions.
- Formalizing additional concepts and properties related to CCS.
- Enhancing the usability of the library for researchers and students.
- Providing detailed documentation and examples for educational purposes.
